## What is JavaScript?
- is both synchronous and asynchronous and its ability to handle asynchronous operation is a crucial aspect of its desingd (using event loop whick makes it asynchronous)
  
- Single threaded --> execuation stack -->execute one thing/task at a time
  
- dynamically types --> data types checked at runtime not at compile time
  
- concurrent language -->

# Introduction to Node

## What is Node.js
- made by Ryhn Bahl in 2009
  
- V8 Engine + morething(Inbuilt modules) => Node.js
  
- an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine. 
  
- It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server side, outside of a web browser, enabling the development of server-side and networking applications
  
- Node.js is designed to be efficient and lightweight, making it well-suited for building scalable and high-performance applications.



## Import and Export

1. Common Javascript
   - Export: module.export = function name
   - Import : Const function name = require('file location')

2. ES Modue
   - Export : export const function name = code
   - Import : import {function name} from 'file location'



## Inbuilt modules
1. OS 
    - const os = require('os')
    - os.cpus()
    - os.hostname()

2. File System
   - const fs = require('fs')



## REPL 
 - R -->Read
 - E -->Evaluate
 - P -->Print
 - L -->Loop
