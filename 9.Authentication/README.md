# Authentication 
- It's just a way of Identifying who the user is.
  
- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity to ensure that they are who they claim to be.
   
- In the context of computer systems, networks, and applications, authentication is a fundamental security measure that helps protect sensitive information and resources from unauthorized access.

- Authentication commonly involves the use of credentials, which are pieces of information that can be used to prove identity.

## Types of Authentication

1. **Usernames and Passwords:**
- Signup/Registration/Create Account with email and password
- Login
- A combination of a username and a password is a widely used form of authentication. 
- The user provides a unique identifier (username) and a secret code (password) to access a system or application.

1. **Biometric Authentication:**
- Biometric authentication involves using unique physical or behavioral characteristics of an individual to verify identity.
-  Examples include fingerprint scans, retina or iris scans, facial recognition, and voice recognition.

1. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) / Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
- Two-factor authentication requires the user to provide two different types of credentials to gain access. 
- This could involve a combination of something the user knows (password) and something the user has (such as a mobile device that generates a one-time code).

1. **Token-Based Authentication:**
- Tokens, such as access tokens or security tokens, are often used in authentication. 
- A user is issued a token upon successful authentication, and this token is then presented for subsequent access to protected resources.

1. **Certificates:**
- Certificates are cryptographic keys that are used for secure communication.
-  They are often used in conjunction with public key infrastructure (PKI) for authentication.

1. **OAuth and OpenID Connect:**
- OAuth and OpenID Connect are protocols commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications. 
- OAuth is primarily focused on authorization, while OpenID Connect extends it to provide identity verification.






# Authorizatio
- Authorization is the process of granting or denying access rights and permissions to authenticated users, systems, or entities based on their identity and the actions they are attempting to perform.
  
- It ensures that users have the appropriate privileges to access specific resources, perform certain operations, or execute particular functions within a system. 
  
- Authorization is a critical aspect of access control and security, helping to protect sensitive information, maintain data integrity, and prevent unauthorized activities.
